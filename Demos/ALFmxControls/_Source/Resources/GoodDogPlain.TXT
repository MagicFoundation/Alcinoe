What is GoodDog Plain?
This is the latest font from Fonthead Design! It is a stripped down
version of my other font called GoodDog Cool. It is still whacky and fun, 
looks great as text, and guaranteed to make your documents fun!
Also if you want the other two fonts in this set-- GoodDog Cool, 
and GoodDog Bones (clip art!), be sure to visit my web site!
You can find them there for free download!

Is it shareware?
No! This is FREEWARE! Use it to your hearts content without any guilt.

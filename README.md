About Skia
==========

Skia is an open-source 2D graphics library that powers 
the graphics engine used by Flutter and the Android 
operating system. The implementation of Skia in Delphi 
marked a significant advancement for the FireMonkey 
framework, as it greatly surpasses the legacy Delphi 
TCanvasGPU graphics engine in nearly every aspect.

#### Key Advantages of Skia: ####

* **Solid Graphics Foundation**: Since Skia is the 
  same graphics engine used by Flutter, apps built 
  with Flutter or Delphi + Skia share the same 
  foundational graphics technology.
* **Performance**: The Skia algorithms are optimized 
  to the extent that they can often render directly 
  onto the form surface without requiring an 
  internal buffer.
* **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Skia offers a 
  consistent graphics engine across all platforms 
  (Windows, iOS, macOS, Android).
* **Rich Features**: Skia provides powerful capabilities 
  typical of a robust graphics engine, including 
  advanced text formatting and shadow rendering.

#### Drawbacks of Skia: ####

* **Increased Package Size**: Adding Skia increases 
  the package size by approximately 25 MB.
* **Dependency on Google**: Skia is a Google product, 
  and while Embarcadero has traditionally focused on 
  offering an independent product free from GAFA domination, 
  using Skia introduces a dependency on Google's technology.
* **OpenGL Limitations**: Under OpenGL, only raster 
  images (CPU) can be shared across different threads. 
  This means that GPU textures cannot be created in 
  background threads and later drawn on the main form 
  surface. Interestingly, there seems to be no noticeable 
  speed improvement when drawing GPU images compared to 
  raster images.
* **Image Rendering Performance**: While Skia excels 
  at drawing shapes directly on the form surface, it is 
  notably slower (4x more slower) than the legacy Delphi 
  canvas (TCanvasGPU) when rendering images onto the form.

#### Performance Challenges with Skia: ####

The slower image rendering is particularly problematic in 
scenarios where we paint everything first onto an internal 
buffer and then render that buffer to the form surface on 
each paint loop—a technique often used to avoid flickering 
and improve performance. Unfortunately, Skia can be up to 
4 times slower at drawing images onto the form surface 
compared to the legacy Delphi TCanvasGPU, which uses 
OpenGL textures.

For example, on a Google Pixel 7, I can render 2000 textures 
simultaneously at 90 FPS using TCanvasGPU. However, with 
Skia, I can only render 500 images at the same frame rate. 
You can verify this using the demo app located at 
[Demos/ALFmxGraphics](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALFmxGraphics).

#### The Chosen Approach: ####

Given these limitations, I’ve decided to use Skia as the 
backend graphics engine in Alcinoe while continuing to 
use the legacy Delphi canvas (TCanvasGPU) for rendering 
on the main form surface. The exception is on Windows, 
where we use Skia for both the backend and the main 
form surface.

#### Platform-Specific Considerations: ####

On Android and iOS, the operating systems already provide 
powerful graphics APIs, and in many cases, these native APIs 
outperform Skia—often by as much as 2x. While the performance 
of the OS graphics APIs is superior, Skia still offers the 
benefit of a unified graphics engine across all platforms, 
along with additional features like animated images.

Material 3 Controls for Delphi: A Modern UI Approach
====================================================

In recent years, Material Design has emerged as a guiding design 
language for developers creating modern, user-friendly, and 
visually appealing applications. With the release of Material You 
(Material Design 3), Google has taken a step further by allowing 
greater personalization and a more dynamic appearance. Developers 
using Delphi can now leverage Material 3 principles to create 
stunning, cohesive interfaces across platforms like Android, iOS, 
Windows, and macOS.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3design.jpg?raw=true" />

## Key Alcinoe Controls for Material 3 Design

### 1. **TALButton**
**TALButton** offers full customization for states such as **Enabled, 
Pressed**, and **Disabled**, allowing for modern Material 3 button 
styles. You can adjust properties like **fill, border, shadow**, and 
**font** to match Material 3’s bold, clear design principles. It 
supports HTML content, enabling you to easily include icons or 
rich text.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3button.png?raw=true" />

### 2. **TALCheckBox and TALRadioButton**
Both controls follow Material 3’s minimalistic and responsive 
design. They include customizable properties for **checkmark, 
border**, and **shadow** and utilize smooth transitions between states. 
Their highly customizable nature allows you to create checkbox 
and radio button components that align with Material 3’s aesthetic.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3checkbox.png?raw=true" width="600" style="width:600px;" />

### 4. **TALSwitch**
**TALSwitch** is designed for easy customization, allowing you to 
control the design of the switch in states such as **Enabled**, 
**Hovered**, **Focused**, **Pressed**, and **Disabled**. The 
control provides smooth, responsive transitions between on and 
off states, reflecting the fluid, adaptable nature of 
Material 3’s switches. The customizable design ensures that 
TALSwitch fits seamlessly into a modern, minimalistic interface, 
offering both visual appeal and optimized performance for 
Delphi applications.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3switch.gif?raw=true" />

### 3. **TALTrackBar and TALRangeTrackBar**
**TALTrackBar** allows for extensive customization of its appearance 
and behavior, making it an ideal choice for implementing Material 3’s 
clean and modern slider design. You can easily customize the track and 
thumb with properties such as **fill**, **stroke**, and **shadow** to 
achieve the sleek, minimalistic look that defines Material 3. The 
slider's interactions, including value indicators and stop indicators, 
are smooth, ensuring responsive feedback as the user interacts with the 
control. Its transitions between states like **Enabled**, **Focused**, 
and **Pressed** contribute to a polished, fluid user experience.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3trackbar.gif?raw=true" />

### 4. **TALEdit and TALMemo**
Alcinoe’s native **TALEdit** and **TALMemo** controls are designed to 
match Material 3’s input fields, offering customizable **border, 
shadow**, and **font** properties. These controls adapt across platforms 
while maintaining a consistent, clean interface for text input, 
with features like autosizing and prompt text.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/material3edit.webp?raw=true" />

## Why Alcinoe for Material 3?
While Material 3 focuses on responsive and adaptive design, 
performance is equally important. Alcinoe’s double-buffered 
rendering ensures that your controls are fast and fluid, 
even during complex UI interactions like scrolling. This 
performance boost aligns perfectly with Material 3’s goal 
of seamless, responsive user interfaces.

Incorporating Alcinoe in your Delphi projects allows you to 
create modern, high-performance apps with a polished 
Material 3 appearance, without compromising on speed or 
cross-platform compatibility.

High-Performance Text Control with HTML Formatting and Interactive Capabilities
===============================================================================

**TALText** is a robust component similar to **TText**, but 
with enhanced capabilities like basic HTML text formatting 
support. Despite incorporating HTML formatting, **TALText** 
delivers substantial performance improvements over **TText**. 
This is achieved through its double-buffered engine, 
which renders text on an internal buffer and then draws 
only the buffer onto the form during each paint cycle. This 
design ensures that **TALText** is extremely fast and efficient.
Additionally, **TALText** enhances functionality by supporting 
mouse event handling, allowing it to detect specific 
HTML elements (such as span IDs and bounds) under the mouse 
pointer. This feature enables interactive text elements, 
making it ideal for applications requiring dynamic, 
responsive text behavior. Learn more at 
[Demos/ALFmxControls](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALFmxControls)

<br/>
  
Video Player for FireMonkey
===========================

**ALVideoPlayer** renders video onto a texture, allowing 
seamless integration into a Delphi form while supporting 
Z-ORDER, enabling controls to be placed on top of the video. 
In contrast, Delphi’s official video players are native 
video player windows overlaid on the form, which do not 
support Z-ORDER.

On Android, **Alcinoe** uses **ExoPlayer**, which provides 
advanced features such as dynamic adaptive streaming over 
HTTP (DASH), HLS, SmoothStreaming, and common encryption—capabilities 
not available in MediaPlayer. **ExoPlayer** is also designed 
to be easily customizable and extendable. On iOS, 
**AVPlayer** is used, offering similar HLS support to 
**ExoPlayer**.

AndroidMerger: Integrate AAR SDK in FMX Android App
===================================================

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/androidmerger.jpg?raw=true"/>

An Android library, also known as an Android Archive (AAR), 
contains everything needed to build an app, including source 
files, resource files, and the manifest. Unlike JARs, AARs 
can include resource files in addition to compiled bytecode.

Integrating an AAR into a Delphi project can be a long and 
complex process, involving extracting resources, manually 
adding them to Delphi deployment files, compiling the 
**R.java** class, checking dependencies, and more.

With **AndroidMerger**, this entire process is automated 
in a single command line. In short, **AndroidMerger** will:

- Use Gradle or an internal implementation to list all dependencies.
- Download libraries and dependencies from local or central Maven repositories.
- Merge the resources of all AARs into a single directory.
- Combine the **AndroidManifest** files of all AARs into **AndroidManifest.template.xml**.
- Merge **google-services.json** into the project's resources.
- Create the **R.jar** with all resource IDs using **aapt** or **aapt2**.
- Update the project file (*.dproj*) to include all resources.
- Generate the Delphi native bridge file from the Java libraries.

Interpolated Animation
======================

The **TALAnimation** component is a refined version of Delphi's 
foundational **TAnimation** object, specifically optimized for 
mobile platforms. Instead of relying on the traditional Timer 
mechanism, this component adopts platform-specific technologies, 
delivering a significantly improved animation experience for 
mobile users.

- On **Android**, animations are seamlessly integrated with 
  the **Choreographer**, ensuring perfect synchronization 
  with the device’s refresh rate.

- On **iOS**, the precision of **DisplayLink** is utilized, 
  resulting in smooth and optimized animation rendering.

A key enhancement of **TALAnimation** is its support for 
custom interpolation algorithms, giving developers the 
flexibility to create unique and complex animation patterns, 
far beyond the traditional ease-in or ease-out sequences.

Inspired by Android's **SpringForce**, the **TALSpringForceAnimation** 
component brings the dynamics of physics-based animations to the 
Delphi platform. This component simulates the real-world behavior 
of objects influenced by spring mechanics, producing animations that 
stretch, bounce, and settle, mirroring the physical world. 

Developers can fine-tune various physical properties of the spring, 
such as stiffness and damping ratio, allowing for a wide range of 
animation behaviors. This flexibility enables developers to create 
animations tailored to the specific nuances of different applications, 
offering a more realistic and engaging user experience.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/empty.png?raw=true" align="right" width="32" height="480" />
  
**TALOverScroller** and **TALVelocityTracker** are key components 
of the **TALScrollEngine**, enhancing user interface interactions. 
**TALOverScroller** manages scrolling and flinging with smooth 
deceleration when users scroll past a view's edge, while 
**TALVelocityTracker** measures touch velocity to determine gesture 
speed and direction. Together, they provide smooth animations and 
intuitive feedback within the scrolling engine.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, we based the **TALScrollEngine** 
on proven Android components, translating **VelocityTracker** and 
**OverScroller** from Java and C++ to Delphi. This ensures a 
high-quality, reliable scrolling experience for Delphi developers, 
using trusted, efficient technologies.

Json Parser
===========

**TALJSONDocument** is a Delphi parser and writer for both **JSON** 
and **BSON** data formats. It supports both **DOM** and **SAX** 
parsers (although a more appropriate name for SAX could be 
**SAJ**—Simple API for JSON—rather than Simple API for XML, the 
well-known SAX terminology is retained). 

In addition to its JSON capabilities, **TALJSONDocument** also 
supports the **BSON** format, using a syntax similar to 
**TALXMLDocument/TXMLDocument**. It can further export JSON/BSON 
data to **TALStringList**, making it a flexible tool for data 
parsing and manipulation in Delphi applications.

Example :

```
    {
      _id: 1, // comments
      name: { first: "John", last: "Backus" },
      birth: new Date('1999-10-21T21:04:54.234Z'),
      contribs: [ "Fortran", "ALGOL", "Backus-Naur Form", "FP" ],
      awards: [
                { award: "National Medal of Science",
                  year: 1975,
                  by: "National Science Foundation" },
                { award: "Turing Award",
                  year: 1977,
                  by: "ACM" }
              ],
      spouse: "",
      address: {},
      phones: []
    }
```

To access the document nodes :

```
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueInt32('_id', 0{default if node not exists});
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueText(['name','first'], ''{default if node not exists});
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueDateTime('birth', Now{default if node not exists});
```

ImageMagick Wrapper for Delphi
==============================

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/imagemagick.png?raw=true"/>

Use **ImageMagick®** to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap 
images. It supports over 200 image formats, including **PNG**, 
**JPEG**, **GIF**, **HEIC**, **TIFF**, **DPX**, **EXR**, **WebP**, 
**Postscript**, **PDF**, and **SVG**.

With ImageMagick, you can resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, 
shear, and transform images. Additionally, it allows for color 
adjustments, the application of various special effects, and the 
drawing of text, lines, polygons, ellipses, and Bézier curves. 
This powerful tool enables a wide range of image manipulations 
within Delphi projects.

Example :

```
    //Create the ImageMagick Library
    ALCreateImageMagickLibrary({alcinoe} + '\Libraries\dll\imagemagick\win32\imagemagick', min(2, System.CPUCount){aThreadLimit});
    try
    
      //create the wand pointer
      var LWand := ALImageMagickLib.NewMagickWand;
      try
    
        //load the image
        if ALImageMagickLib.MagickReadImage(LWand, pansiChar(aInputFilename)) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
        
        //Set the compression quality
        if ALImageMagickLib.MagickSetImageCompressionQuality(LWand,80) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
    
        //autorate the image
        if ALImageMagickLib.MagickAutoOrientImage(LWand) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
    
        //Resize the image using the Lanczos filter
        if ALImageMagickLib.MagickResizeImage(LWand, 640, 480, LanczosFilter) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
           
        //save the image
        ALImageMagickLib.MagickWriteImage(LWand, pansiChar(aOutputFilename));
    
      finally
        ALImageMagickLib.DestroyMagickWand(LWand);
      end;
  
    finally
      ALFreeImageMagickLibrary;
    end;

Streamlining Object Initialization with TALInit
===============================================

In the constant evolution of software development, we often find ourselves
seeking ways to reduce boilerplate code and enhance the maintainability of our
projects. One such instance where boilerplate can become cumbersome is in the
initialization of class fields. The traditional method involves explicitly
setting each field's value in the constructor, which can be tedious, especially
for classes with numerous fields. Enter TALInit—a feature that allows
automatic initialization of object fields based on their attributes.

#### The Traditional Way ####

In the typical approach, developers manually initialize object fields in the
constructor. Take the following class as an example:

```
    TAutoInitObject = class(TObject)
    public
      CharValue: Char;
      ChildObject: TChildObject;
    public
      constructor Create; virtual;
      destructor Destroy; override;
    End;
```

Here, each field is initialized in the Create constructor:

```
  constructor TAutoInitObject.create(const aOwner: Tform1; const AAutoInit: Boolean);
  begin
    CharValue := 'A';
    ChildObject := TChildObject.create;
    ChildObject.Name := 'AnObject';
    ChildObject.Value := 12.2;
  end;

  destructor TAutoInitObject.Destroy;
  begin
    ALFreeandNil(ChildObject);
    inherited;
  end;
```

While this method offers precise control, it can become tedious for large
classes with numerous fields.

#### The TALInit Way ####

Imagine having a mechanism that not only automates this but is also as fast as
the traditional way - yes, you read that right. TALInit achieves this
remarkable feat.

```
  TAutoInitObject = class(TObject)
  public
    [TALInit('A')]
    CharValue: Char;
    [TALInit('Name:AnObject;Value:12.2')]
    ChildObject: TChildObject;
  End;
```

By using custom attributes, every field within the object can be automatically
initialized based on its corresponding attribute. This eliminates the need for
manually setting each field within the constructor. The above snippet showcases
just how concise and readable object field initialization can become with
TALInit.

#### Performance - A Game Changer: ####

One of the strongest advantages of using TALInit is its performance. When
introducing automation, a natural concern is the overhead that might come with
it. However, TALInit is designed to be as efficient as the traditional way
of initializing fields. This means developers can enjoy the convenience
without having to worry about any hidden costs in execution time.

MongoDb client
==============

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/mongodb.webp?raw=true"  width="600" style="width:600px;"/>

This is a Delphi driver with **connection pooling** for accessing a **MongoDB** 
server. Connection pooling refers to a cache of database connections that are 
maintained for reuse, reducing the need to establish a new connection for 
each request. Once a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and can 
be reused for future database requests. 

If all connections in the pool are in use, a new connection is created and 
added to the pool. This approach reduces the time required to establish 
connections, enhancing performance and efficiency when interacting with 
the MongoDB database.

WebSocket client
================

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/websocket.png?raw=true"  width="540" style="width:540px;"/>

The **WebSocket client** for Delphi is built on top of **WinHTTP** and 
provides a communication protocol for two-way, interactive communication 
sessions between a user's browser and a server. This enables sending 
messages to a server and receiving event-driven responses without the 
need for constant polling. 

With WebSocket, real-time communication is streamlined, making it ideal 
for applications that require low-latency, continuous data exchange 
between the client and server.

Fast TStringList
================

**TALStringList** functions similarly to Delphi's **TStringList**, 
but with significant performance improvements. When the list is sorted, 
it uses a quicksort algorithm to search for `name=value` pairs, enabling 
much faster lookups. 

Additionally, **TALStringList** uses a locale-independent sorting 
algorithm based on the 8-bit ordinal value of each character, rather 
than Delphi's **AnsiCompareText** and **AnsiCompareStr**. This results 
in sorting speeds up to 10 times faster than Delphi's **TStringList**.

Unlike **TStringList**, **TALStringList** is not Unicode-based but is 
a fully **Ansi** string list, optimized for performance.

execute PHP scripts directly in your Delphi program without the 
need for a web server. 

This component leverages the **CGI/FastCGI** interface (using **php-cgi.exe**) 
to communicate with the PHP engine, making it easy to integrate PHP 
functionality into Delphi-based projects.

DELPHI D2009+ (UNICODE)
=======================

There's no doubt that **Unicode** was necessary for a 
product like Delphi. However, the approach Embarcadero 
chose for its implementation has raised some concerns. 
Instead of adopting **UTF-8** through 8-bit strings, 
they opted to migrate from 8-bit strings to 16-bit strings 
(UTF-16). This decision made migrating Delphi applications 
prior to D2009 challenging, especially for those that 
relied on the assumption that strings were 8-bit. 

For more insights into why **UTF-16** can be problematic, 
here's an excellent article: [utf8everywhere.org](http://www.utf8everywhere.org/).

Starting with **D2009**, **AnsiString** now has a code 
page, and some transliteration occurs when assigning an 
**AnsiString** with one code page to another **AnsiString** 
with a different code page (e.g., OldCodePage => UTF-16 => 
NewCodePage). To prevent unwanted transliterations, it's 
crucial to set the project's code page to the desired 
one (e.g., 65001 for UTF-8) and call 
`SetMultiByteConversionCodePage(CP_UTF8)` at the beginning 
of the program.

Additionally, avoid mixing different string types 
(e.g., **UTF8String** and **AnsiString**) even if they share 
the same code page. The Delphi compiler doesn't recognize this 
at compile time and will still perform unnecessary 
transliterations (e.g., `MyAnsiStringUTF8 := MyUTF8String` 
results in **UTF-8 => UTF-16 => UTF-8**).

To minimize these issues, it's best to use **AnsiString** 
exclusively in your code, even when handling UTF-8 content. 
Always ensure that **AnsiString** is paired with 
`SetMultiByteConversionCodePage(CP_UTF8)` to prevent 
undesired conversions.

Alcinoe
=======

Alcinoe is a library of visual and non-visual components for 
Delphi. These components can be used in commercial, shareware, 
freeware, and open-source projects at no cost. Alcinoe is 
compatible with Delphi Alexandria 11.3. If you find this 
project useful, please consider giving it a 'star' on GitHub. 
It doesn't cost anything, but it helps to promote the code.

Install Alcinoe
---------------

We need some time to rename unit/class/function names. To 
help you automatically perform this renaming task in your 
project to the latest version of Alcinoe, we provide you 
with the tool called CodeRenaming. You can find this tool 
at the following link: [CodeRenaming](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Tools/CodeRenaming).

If you plan to use the FMX (FireMonkey) framework with 
Alcinoe, you will need to patch the original Delphi 
source code. To do this, you need to go to [{alcinoe}\Embarcadero\Alexandria\11_3](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Embarcadero/Alexandria/11_3/) 
and run [update.bat](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Embarcadero/Alexandria/11_3/update.bat) 
to retrieve and patch the original Delphi source code. 
The batch file assumes that the original source code is 
located in c:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\22.0\source\ 
and that you have GIT in your path. Later, you will need to 
include all subdirectories located in [{alcinoe}\Embarcadero\Alexandria\11_3](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Embarcadero/Alexandria/11_3/)
in your project search path.

You will also need to run [CompileAll.bat](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/CompileAll.bat) 
to download the iOS/Android libraries, build the 
Alcinoe Jars, build the BPL, build all tools located 
in [{alcinoe}\Tools](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Tools/), 
and finally build all demos located in [{alcinoe}\Demos](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/). 
Note that some demos use [devexpress](https://www.devexpress.com/).

If you don't plan to use any Alcinoe visual components at 
design time, you don't need to install anything. Just add 
[{alcinoe}\Source](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Source) 
to the search path of your project.

However, if you want to use visual components at design time, 
you need to install the BPL. Launch Delphi and go to 
Component > Install Packages... > and choose the BPL located 
in [{alcinoe}\Libraries\bpl\Alcinoe\Win32\Alexandria\AlcinoeAlexandria.bpl](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Libraries/bpl/Alcinoe/Win32/Alexandria). 
You also need to add [{alcinoe}\Source](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Source) 
and all subdirectories located in [{alcinoe}\Embarcadero\Alexandria\11_3](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Embarcadero/Alexandria/11_3/) 
to your search path.


Propose a change using GitHub
-----------------------------

If you need to suggest a change to the Alcine directory, 
please follow these steps:

1. To make changes to the Alcinoe repository, you'll need 
   to fork it. Don't worry, forking simply involves 
   creating a copy of the Alcinoe source code that you can 
   edit as you wish.  
   
   ![Fork](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/img-27.jpg?raw=true)

2. Make the necessary edits to the source code, and then 
   commit and push the changes to your forked repository.

3. Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit your 
   proposal. To do so, go to your forked repository, select 
   'Contribute,' and then choose 'Open a pull request.'  
   
   ![Contribute](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/img-28.jpg?raw=true)


AndroidMerger: Integrate AAR SDK in FMX Android app
---------------------------------------------------
                                 
<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/img-26.jpg?raw=true" alt="video player for FireMonkey" width="540" style="width:540px;"/>

An Android library, also called as Android Archive, includes 
everything you need to build an app like source files, 
resource files, manifest etc. This is the reason why AARs are 
different from JARs. AARs can contain resource files as well 
other than compiled byte code. 

Adding such library to Delphi project is long and convoluted 
process consisting of extracting resources from library, 
manually adding them to Delphi deployment files, compiling 
R.Java class, checking dependancies, etc.

With AndroidMerger all of the above can now be done 
automatically in a single command line. In brief 
AndroidMerger will:
 
* Use graddle or internal implementation to list all dependencies.
* Download libraries and dependancies from local or central maven repository.
* Merge the resources of all AARs inside a single directory.
* Merge the AndroidManifest files of all AARs inside AndroidManifest.template.xml.
* Merge google-services.json in the resources of the project.
* Create the R.jar with all resource IDs using aapt or aapt2.
* Update the project file (.dproj) to include all resources.
* Generate the Delphi native bridge file from the Java libraries.

Opengl video player for FireMonkey
----------------------------------

ALVideoPlayer renders video to a texture, which is 
important for integrating the video into a Delphi form and 
supporting Z-ORDER for placing controls on top of it. 
Official Delphi video players are just native video player 
windows on top of the form and do not support Z-ORDER.

For Android, Alcinoe uses ExoPlayer, which supports 
features such as dynamic adaptive streaming over 
HTTP (DASH), HLS, SmoothStreaming, and common encryption 
that are not supported by MediaPlayer. ExoPlayer is 
designed to be easy to customize and extend. For iOS, I use 
AVPlayer with support for HLS, similar to ExoPlayer.

WebRTC Delphi wrapper
---------------------

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which 
enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally 
stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary 
data between browsers and mobile applications without requiring 
an intermediary. The set of standards that comprises WebRTC 
makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing 
peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user installs plug-ins 
or any other third-party software.

<p align="center">

Firemonkey native iOS/Android TEdit and TMemo
---------------------------------------------

The idea is to combine FireMonkey controls with native 
platform controls when the functionality of a specific 
control becomes difficult to implement solely with 
FireMonkey (such as web browser, edit, memo, date picker, 
etc.).

Fast/double-buffered FireMonkey controls with native draw
---------------------------------------------------------

* Rectangle
* Circle
* Text (Can also draw html text on iOS/android/win/macOS)
* Glyph
* etc.

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/img-23.png?raw=true" alt="TALRectangle" width="600" style="width:600px;" />

<img src="https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/blob/master/References/DocImages/img-8.jpg?raw=true" alt="TALRectangle" width="600" style="width:600px;" />

#### The fact ####

Painting FireMonkey controls can be slow at times, which 
can affect the scrolling fluidity. For instance, the basic 
TRectangle with round corners takes approximately 3ms to 
paint. If you have 20 visible TRectangles on your screen, 
it would take around 60ms to repaint the entire screen 
(assuming you only have TRectangles and not other controls 
like TLabel or TCheckbox). Doing the math, if it takes 
100ms to repaint the screen, you can only achieve around 10 
frames per second (in reality, it would be much less). As a 
result, scrolling can't be smooth.

#### The solution #### 
 
I didn't want to rebuild the FireMonkey controls, which 
would have been a huge job for me. Instead, I tried to find 
an intermediate solution by adding a "double-buffered" 
property to the FireMonkey controls. This approach involves 
painting the control on a buffer stored directly in the GPU 
memory (through TTexture) instead of repainting the controls 
for every single pixel move of the scrollbox. When the 
system asks me to repaint the controls, I simply redraw the 
buffer TTexture, rather than calling the paint algorithm 
again.

#### The results ####  

As I mentioned before, it used to take 3ms just to paint a 
simple TRectangle with round corners. With my 
double-buffered property, it now takes around 0.1ms! As a 
result, the scrolling looks much more fluid now!

#### OpenGL draw => Replaced by native iOS/android draw ####

Most of the basic shapes in FireMonkey, such as TRectangle 
and TCircle, use OpenGL for drawing. However, this is not 
very efficient - for example, to draw a circle under 
OpenGL, you actually need to draw 50 triangles. This often 
results in poor quality. Drawing a round rectangle is even 
worse because it requires calculating the path and then 
drawing it, which is much slower than drawing a circle.

Another problem is that all of these shapes depend on the 
Form.quality setting. If you set form.quality to high 
quality, then everything you draw on the canvas will be 
anti-aliased, which can be problematic - for example, an 
image may be anti-aliased even if you don't want it to be. 
On the other hand, if you set form.quality to high 
performance, then the draw will be very rough, with no 
anti-aliasing.

To resolve these issues, I built the buffer of my control 
using the native Android/iOS API. In this way, we can have 
high-quality drawing at high speed without being dependent 
on the form.quality setting.

Location Sensor for Android/iOS
-------------------------------

The TALLocationSensor component is a Delphi component that grants access to
location services on iOS and Android devices. It enables the retrieval of the
device's current location, and can provide location updates as the device's
location changes. It supports a range of location providers, including GPS,
cellular network triangulation, and Wi-Fi positioning.

Aside from granting access to location services, TALLocationSensor also
automates the process of acquiring the user's permission to use the location
sensor on both iOS and Android devices. The component can handle situations
where the user has previously refused access to their location. The
TALLocationSensor component provides a comprehensive solution for developers
seeking to integrate location-based functionality into their apps without
having to worry about low-level implementation details. Learn more at 
[{alcinoe}\Demos\ALLocationSensor](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALLocationSensor)

Json Parser
-----------

TALJSONDocumentA is a Delphi parser/writer for JSON/BSON 
data formats. It supports both DOM and SAX parsers. (Note 
that a better name for SAX could be SAJ for Simple API for 
JSON instead of Simple API for XML, but as the concept of 
SAX is well-known, I will keep this name.) TALJSONDocumentA 
also supports BSON format and uses a syntax similar to 
TALXMLDocument/TXMLDocument. Additionally, TALJSONDocumentA 
can export Json/Bson data to TALStringListA.

Example :

```
    {
      _id: 1, // comments
      name: { first: "John", last: "Backus" },
      birth: new Date('1999-10-21T21:04:54.234Z'),
      contribs: [ "Fortran", "ALGOL", "Backus-Naur Form", "FP" ],
      awards: [
                { award: "National Medal of Science",
                  year: 1975,
                  by: "National Science Foundation" },
                { award: "Turing Award",
                  year: 1977,
                  by: "ACM" }
              ],
      spouse: "",
      address: {},
      phones: []
    }
```

To access the document nodes :

```
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueInt32('_id', 0{default if node not exists});
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueText(['name','first'], ''{default if node not exists});
    MyJsonDoc.GetChildNodeValueDateTime('birth', Now{default if node not exists});
```

ImageMagick wrapper for Delphi
------------------------------

Use ImageMagick® to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap 
images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats 
(over 200) including PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, TIFF, DPX, EXR, 
WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, 
flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, 
adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw 
text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.

Example :

```
    var LWand: PMagickWand;
    begin
    
      //Create the ImageMagick Library
      alCreateImageMagickLibrary({alcinoe} + '\Libraries\dll\imagemagick\win32\imagemagick', min(2, System.CPUCount){aThreadLimit});
      try
      
        //create the wand pointer
        LWand := ALImageMagickLib.NewMagickWand;
        try
      
          //load the image
          if ALImageMagickLib.MagickReadImage(LWand, pansiChar(aInputFilename)) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
          
          //Set the compression quality
          if ALImageMagickLib.MagickSetImageCompressionQuality(LWand,80) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
      
          //autorate the image
          if ALImageMagickLib.MagickAutoOrientImage(LWand) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
      
          //Resize the image using the Lanczos filter
          if ALImageMagickLib.MagickResizeImage(LWand, 640, 480, LanczosFilter) <> MagickTrue then RaiseLastMagickWandError(LWand);
             
          //save the image
          ALImageMagickLib.MagickWriteImage(LWand, pansiChar(aOutputFilename));
      
        finally
          ALImageMagickLib.DestroyMagickWand(LWand);
        end;
    
      finally
        alFreeImageMagickLibrary;
      end;

    end;
```

MongoDb client
--------------

This is a Delphi driver (with connection pooling) for 
accessing a MongoDB server. Connection pooling is a cache 
of database connections that are maintained so that they 
can be reused when future requests to the database are 
required. After a connection is created in connection 
pooling, it is placed in the pool and is used over again so 
that a new connection does not have to be established. If 
all the connections are being used, a new connection is 
made and added to the pool. Connection pooling also reduces 
the amount of time a user must wait to establish a 
connection to the database. Learn more at 
[{alcinoe}/Source/Alcinoe.MongoDB.Client.pas](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Source/Alcinoe.MongoDB.Client.pas)


WebSocket client
----------------

The WebSocket client for Delphi is implemented on top of 
WinHTTP. WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables 
two-way interactive communication sessions between a user's 
browser and a server. This allows you to send messages to a 
server and receive event-driven responses without having to 
poll the server for a reply. Learn more at 
[{alcinoe}\Demos\ALWinHTTPWebSocketClient](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALWinHTTPWebSocketClient)


Fast TStringList
----------------

TALStringListA works the same as Delphi's TStringList, 
except that it allows you to search for a name=value 
using a quicksort algorithm when the list is sorted. 
Additionally, TALStringListA uses a locale-independent 
algorithm (based on the 8-bit ordinal value of each 
character) instead of the AnsiCompareText and 
AnsiCompareStr used by Delphi's TStringList. As a 
result, sorting in TALStringListA is up to 10 times 
faster than in Delphi's TStringList. Furthermore, 
TALStringListA is not a Unicode TStringList, but a 100% 
Ansi StringList. You can start exploring this feature 
with the demo located at 
[{alcinoe}\Demos\ALSortedListBenchmark](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALSortedListBenchmark)


PHP runner
----------

ALPHPRunnerEngine is a simple yet useful component that 
allows you to easily use PHP (any version) as a scripting 
language in Delphi applications. With ALPhpRunnerEngine, 
you can execute PHP scripts within the Delphi program 
without the need for a web server. The component uses 
the CGI/FastCGI interface (php-cgi.exe) of PHP to 
communicate with the PHP engine. Learn more at 
[{alcinoe}\Demos\ALPhpRunner](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe/tree/master/Demos/ALPhpRunner)

DELPHI D2009+ (UNICODE)
-----------------------

No mistake, Unicode was necessary for a product like Delphi. 
However, the way Embarcadero decided to implement it is 
questionable. They chose to migrate from 8-bit strings to 
16-bit strings instead of implementing Unicode through 
8-bit strings (UTF-8). This made the migration of some 
Delphi applications prior to D2009 very difficult, especially 
for applications that assumed that strings were 8-bit. 
Here's a very good article about why you should avoid 
using UTF-16: [utf8everywhere.org](http://www.utf8everywhere.org/)

Starting with D2009, AnsiString now has a codepage, 
and some transliteration (OldCodePage => UTF-16 => 
NewCodePage) will occur when assigning one AnsiString 
with a different codepage to another AnsiString with 
a different codepage. To avoid this, it's important to 
always set the project option to the code page you want 
(e.g., 65001 for UTF-8) and also to call 
SetMultiByteConversionCodePage(CP_UTF8) at the beginning 
of the program. Additionally, it's crucial to avoid using 
two different string types (e.g., UTF8String and 
AnsiString) even if they have the same codepage because 
the compiler, at compile time, doesn't know that the 
codepage is the same and will do a transliteration 
(e.g., MyAnsiStringUTF8 := MyUTF8String will result in 
UTF-8 => UTF-16 => UTF-8). This is why we use only 
AnsiString in all our code instead of UTF8String (even 
when we assume that the string contains only UTF-8 
characters) to avoid these transliterations. Always follow 
the rule of using only AnsiString with 
SetMultiByteConversionCodePage(CP_UTF8).

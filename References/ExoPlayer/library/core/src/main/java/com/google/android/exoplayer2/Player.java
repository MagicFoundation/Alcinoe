/**
 * A media player interface defining traditional high-level functionality, such as the ability to
 * play, pause, seek and query properties of the currently playing media.
 * <p>
 * Some important properties of media players that implement this interface are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>They can provide a {@link Timeline} representing the structure of the media being played,
 *     which can be obtained by calling {@link #getCurrentTimeline()}.</li>
 *     <li>They can provide a {@link TrackGroupArray} defining the currently available tracks,
 *     which can be obtained by calling {@link #getCurrentTrackGroups()}.</li>
 *     <li>They contain a number of renderers, each of which is able to render tracks of a single
 *     type (e.g. audio, video or text). The number of renderers and their respective track types
 *     can be obtained by calling {@link #getRendererCount()} and {@link #getRendererType(int)}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>They can provide a {@link TrackSelectionArray} defining which of the currently available
 *     tracks are selected to be rendered by each renderer. This can be obtained by calling
 *     {@link #getCurrentTrackSelections()}}.</li>

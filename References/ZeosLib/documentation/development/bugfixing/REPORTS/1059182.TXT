Error Description:

I'm using ZeosDBO 6.1.5 to create a database for my 
application, and I'm having the following problem: I 
cannot create a Foreign Key (FK) constraint in my DB. 
What happens is that to create FKs in FB 1.5 (and 
Interbase 6 too) you must be the only user connected 
to the DB. That is a limitation of FB and IB. 

The DSQL statement for that would be something like 
this: 

ALTER TABLE PESSOA ADD CONSTRAINT 
FK_PESSOA_CIDADE FOREIGN KEY (IDCIDADE) 
REFERENCES CIDADE (IDCIDADE); 

If I use isql to do that, it works fine. 

Well, I got the connected users list (from here), and as 
soon as you Connect with a ZConnection component, 
you always have 2 connected users. 

Is that correct? That would prevent me from creating 
FKs with Zeos.

Actions done form Bugfixing:

Did you start your application in delphi?
Then you have two connections (1. the connection set to 
connected=true on the form within the ide; 2. the connection 
within your application)

Error Description:

A project using the ZeosDBO components directly
compiles the ZeosDBO source files (directories of them
must be in search path). Thus they are compiled with
the project's compiler settings. If these contain "Full
Boolean Evaluation", they project will not run, because
the initialization of unit core/ZTokenizer.pas fails.
Reason: Somewhere
function TZSymbolNode.FindChildWithChar(Value: Char):
TZSymbolNode; 
is called, and it contains the line
if (Current = nil) or (Current.Character = Value) then
which clearly fails with full boolean eval. 

Suggestion: add a compiler switch to zeos.inc which
disables Full Boolean evaluation by default.

Actions done form Bugfixing:

Added {$B-} to Zeos.inc.

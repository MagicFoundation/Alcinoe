# Comments
# --------
# The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a
# line.  Anything following the # character on a line is considered a
# comment.
#
# Examples:
#
#    # This is a comment
#    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment
#
# Entries
# -------
# The default value for each entry is listed to the right of the "=".
# To activate an entry, remove the leading "#"s and supply the desired
# value.
#
# Please note, a number of the values are specified in **Bytes** (Not KB).
# Accordingly, we have provided some simple conversion tables at the bottom
# of this file.
#
# There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.
# 
# Integer
# --------
# Integers is what they sound like, an integral value. Examples:
#   1
#   42
#   4711
# 
# Boolean
# -------
# Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 (zero) being "false" and
# non-zero is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend you
# only use 0/1.
# 
# String
# ------
# Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Examples:
#   RootDirectory  = /opt/firebird
#   RemotePipeName = pipe47

# Database Paths/Directories
#
# DatabaseAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict, 
# provide ';'-separated trees list, where database files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'Full' gives full access to all files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror', 
# for unix - '/db;/mnt/mirrordb'). If you choose 'None', then only
# databases listed in aliases.conf can be attached.

# UNCONTROLLED DATABASE ACCESS MAY COMPROMISE YOUR SYSTEM!
# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT
# DATABASE LOCATIONS!
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#DatabaseAccess = Full


# ----------------------------
# External File Paths/Directories

# ExternalFileAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose 
# Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where external files 
# are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'None' disables any use of external files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalTables',

# (see above). Default value 'Restrict UDF' provides the same restrictions
# as in FB 1.0. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalFunctions', 
# for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').

# ----------------------------
# Temporary directories
#
# Provide ';'-separated trees list, where temporary files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value is determined using FIREBIRD_TMP,
# TEMP or TMP environment options. Every directory item may have optional
# size argument to limit its storage, this argument follows the directory
# name and must be separated by at least one space character. If the size
# argument is omitted or invalid, then all available space in this

# ----------------------------
# Number of cached database pages
#
# This sets the number of pages from any one database that can be held
# in cache at once. If you increase this value, the engine will

# Boolean evaluation method (complete or shortcut)
#
# If your SQL code depends on side-effects of full evaluation of OR

# ----------------------------
# 
# Determines the number of seconds that the lock manager will wait after a
# conflict has been encountered before purging locks from dead processes

# This option controls whether to call abort() when internal error or BUGCHECK
# is encountered thus invoke post-mortem debugger which can dump core suitable 
# for off-line analysis. When disabled engine tries to minimize damage and 
# continue execution. 
#
# Note that setting this option to 1 makes engine produce traceable coredumps 
# when something nasty like SIGSEGV happens inside UDF. On Windows enabling 
# this option makes engine invoke JIT debugger facilities when errors happen.
#
# For debugging builds (DEV_BUILD), default value is 1 (Enabled)

#BugcheckAbort = 0


# Prior to Firebird 1.5 various SELECT expressions generated unnamed
# columns. This did not conform to the SQL standard. Fb 1.5 saw the
# introduction of default aliases for these unnamed columns. In some
# cases, particularly if string concatenation is used (via the ||
# operator) this breaks existing scripts.
#
# This setting will affect aliases generated via CONCATENATION,
# CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and EXTRACT. Setting
# the value to true will disable the alias generation. It is only
# recommended to be used where legacy scripts need to be supported.
# It will be marked deprecated in Firebird 2.0 and removed in
# Firebird 3.0.

# or may not prevent eventual inactive client disconnection for other OS.
#
# Normally, Firebird uses SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to keep track of 
# active connections. If you do not like default 2-hour keepalive timeout
# then adjust your server OS settings appropriately. On UNIX-like OS's, 
# modify contents of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_*. On Windows,

# ----------------------------
# Locking and shared memory parameters
#
# Bytes of shared memory allocated for lock manager. 
# In Classic mode, the size given is used for the initial allocation. The
# table expands dynamically up to the limit of memory. In SuperServer, the
# initial size is also the final size.

# available
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockSemCount = 32

#
# When a connection wants to lock an object, it gets a lock request 
# block which specifies the object and the lock level requested. Each
# locked object has a lock block. Request blocks are connected to those
# lock blocks either as requests that have been granted, or as pending
# requests. 
#
# The settings:
# 	1 means locks are granted first come, first served.
#	0 means emulate InterBase v3.3 behavior, where locks are granted 
#	  as soon as they are available; can result in lock request
#       starvation.
#
# Type: integer/boolean
#
#LockGrantOrder = 1

#
# In Classic, only one client process may access the lock table at any
# time. Access to the lock table is governed by a mutex. The mutex can
# be requested conditionally - a wait is a failure and the request must
# be retried - or unconditionally - the request will wait until it is
# satisfied. This parameter establishes the number of attempts that
# will be made conditionally. Zero value means unconditional mode.
# Relevant only on SMP machines.
#
# Type: integer
#
#LockAcquireSpins = 0

#
# ----------------------------
# Which CPUs should be used (Windows Only)
#
# In an SMP system, sets which processors can be used by the server.  
# The value is taken from a bit map in which each bit represents a CPU.
# Thus, to use only the first processor, the value is 1. To use both
# CPU 1 and CPU 2, the value is 3. To use CPU 2 and CPU 3, the value
# is 6. The default value is 1.

#
# The wait time, in milli-seconds (ms), before the priority of:
#	- an active thread is reduced to 'Low', or

# Remove protection against opening databases on NFS mounted volumes 
# 
#     ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** 
#
# This option removes an important safety feature of Firebird and can 
# cause irrecoverable database corruption. Do not use this option unless 
# you understand the risks and are prepared to accept the loss of the 
# contents of your database.
# Unless this configuration option is changed from 0 to 1, Firebird can 
# open a database only if the database is stored on a drive physically 
# attached to the local computer - the computer running that copy of 
# Firebird. Requests for connections to databases stored on NFS mounted 
# drives are redirected to a Firebird server running on the computer that 
# "owns" the disk. 
# This restriction prevents two different copies of Firebird from opening 
# the same database without coordinating their activities. Uncoordinated 
# access by multiple copies of Firebird will corrupt a database. On a local 
# system, the system-level file locking prevents uncoordinated access to 
# the database file.  
# NFS does not provide a reliable way to detect multiple users of a file on 
# an NFS mounted disk. If a second copy of Firebird connects to a database on 
# an NFS mounted disk, it will corrupt the database.
# Under some circumstances, running a Firebird server on the computer that 
# owns NFS mounted volumes is inconvenient or impossible. Applications that 
# use the "embedded" variant of Firebird and never share access to a database 
# can use this option to permit direct access to databases on NFS mounted 
# volumes.   
# DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

# Remove protection against redirecting requests to other servers
#
#     ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** 
#
# Ability to redirect requests to other servers was initially present
# in Interbase, but was broken by Borland in Interbase 6.0, when
# they added SQL dialects. Request redirection was fixed in firebird 2.0,
# but today such behaviour (proxy) seems to be dangerous from security
# point of view. Imagine, you have one carefully protected firebird server, 
# access to which is possible from global net. But in case when this server 
# has access to your internal LAN (may and should be restricted, 
# but often possible), it will work as a gateway for incoming requests like:
# firebird.your.domain.com:internal_server:/private/database.fdb
# It's enough to know name/IP of some internal server on your LAN, and for 
# this connection one even need not know login/password on external server. 
# Such gateway easily overrides firewall, installed to protect your LAN 
# from outside attack.

Delphi XE3 and C++Builder XE3) an updated support for all targets.</p>

<p>Multiple bugs have been
fixed; for detailed change logs, use the facilities of our Subversion repository
at Sourceforge.net&nbsp;
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/</a>
, see below.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Head changes:</span>

 <li>SVN 1.7 support in JCL Version control integration</li>
 <li>zlibh.pas and JclCompression.pas: new option to use RTL zlib</li>
 <li>JclUnicode.pas and others: the RTL Unicode database is now fully supported and does not require the JCL Unicode database anymore</li>
 <li>JclUnicode.pas: update to Unicode Character Database (UCD) 6.0</li>
 <li>pcre.pas: update to PCRE 8.31 with JIT and 16-bit character support</li>
 <li>favorite combobox and custom open dialog: support with Vista new-style open dialogs</li>
 <li>Exception dialog: 64-bit compatibility</li>
 <li>Stack tracking now supports Win64</li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
   <p>As of JCL 2.0, the library does not support Delphi 5, C++Builder 5, Kylix 3 and Delphi.net anymore;</p>
   <p>Due to many internal failure, we do not provide full support for Delphi 2005: JCL for Delphi 2005 should compile, it may work or not.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Windows only)&nbsp;Installation&nbsp;options:</span></p>

<p>Packages compiled by the JCL installer don't contain any debug
informations to keep their size as small as possible.</p>

<p>The JEDI Code Library packages are required by some 3rd party packages
(including the JEDI Visual Component Library - JVCL), the installer generates
them if the "Packages" node is checked.</p>

<p>The installer can generate MAP informations for each package. These informations
can be linked into binaries to become JCL debug data or be converted to .jdbg files.
Once linked MAP files could be deleted. These options are subnodes of the "Packages" node.</p>

<p>For BDS 2006, RAD Studio 2007, RAD Studio 2009, RAD Studio 2010, RAD Studio XE, RAD Studio XE2, 
RAD Studio XE3, RAD Studio XE4, RAD Studio XE5, RAD Studio XE6, RAD Studio XE7, RAD Studio XE8, 
RAD Studio 10, RAD Studio 10.1, and RAD Studio 10.2 the
compiler introduced a new option to make the same packages available in C++,
by checking the "Dual packages" option of the "Packages" node, you will be able
to call functions of the JCL from C++ code.</p>

<hr><br>

<h3><a name="notes">Installation notes</a></h3>

<ul>

  <li>Free Pascal (http://www.freepascal.org/) support has been updated for
   this release; most units fromsource/common work with FP 2.2.</li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation for Turbo Delphi</span></p>

<p>The JEDI Code Library can be compiled targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer and Turbo Delphi Professional.
Turbo Delphi Professional is recognized as BDS 2006, you have to download its command line compiler from
CodeGear website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codegear.com/Default.aspx?tabid=160">http://www.codegear.com/Default.aspx?tabid=160</a>&nbsp;
to install the full JCL on this tool.</p>

<p>To install the JCL targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer, consider the following checks:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If you have an other supported version of Delphi/C++Builder on this computer, it should automatically be
  detected and the installer will process as usual.</li>

  <li>If you only have Turbo Delphi Explorer (and no other tools) on the computer, the installer cannot be
  compiled. You have to use the Turbo Explorer flavor of the JCL that contains a precompiled installer. However,
  you will not be able to install any experts.</li>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation on C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8:</span></p>

<ul>

  <li>These products cannot be used to build the JCL installer, you need an
  other supported product to install JCL experts on these products.</li>

  <li>These products are not able to use the JCL library as a runtime library.
  You cannot write managed applications and managed packages based on the JCL.</li>

  <li>These products are not shipped with their native compilers, you have to
  download it from codecentral (<a href="http://cc.codegear.com/">http://cc.codegear.com/</a>).
  The item (<a href="http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21333">http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21333</a>)
  &nbsp;contains the native compiler to be installed in Delphi 8.
  The item (<a href="http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21334">http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21334</a>)
  &nbsp;contains the native compiler to be installed in C#Builder 1.
  These zip files have to be extracted in the products directory using the standard pattern:</li>

</ul>

<pre>		   Executable files (exe and dll)      - BDS\X.0\bin<br>		   Compiler files (dcp and dcu)        - BDS\X.0\lib<br>		   Toolsapi source files               - BDS\X.0\source\ToolsAPI<br></pre>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Default installation</span></p>

<p>For all others versions of Delphi, C++Builder and BDS, simply launch Install.bat
and the installer window will let you configure options and install the library.</p>

<hr><br>

<h3><a name="manual">Manual Installation</a></h3>

<p>Although it is not recommended, a manual installation is possible. You will have
to manually configure options for the library. That is done by modifying an included
file.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For each tool you want to install the JCL in, repeat the following steps:</p>

<h3><a name="issues">Reporting bugs</a></h3>

<p>The general rule is: <b><font color="#ff0000">If you want to get a
bug fixed you need to log it!</font></b></p>

<p>An issue tracking tool can be accessed via ('Code Library' category):
<a href="http://issuetracker.delphi-jedi.org/">http://issuetracker.delphi-jedi.org/</a></p>

<p>Please be aware that you are allowed there to enter feature request and code donations as well.</p>

<p>The JEDI issue tracker is based up on the Mantis BugTracker Open
Source project. More background information about it is available on its homepage&nbsp;
<a href="http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net/">http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net</a></p>

<hr><br>

<h3><a name="releases">Downloads of stable sources</a></h3>

<p>These sources are official JCL releases and file status can be considered as
stable for use in final applications. During the past years, there have been around 2
or 3 releases per year.</p>

</p>

<hr><br>

<h3><a name="development">Development sources</a></h3>

<p>These files are under active development and may cause some incompatibilities
and some conflicts with existing code. You should not use these files in final
applications. The JCL development team provides these files for testing and
feedback from users.</p>

<p>You can download snapshots of the Subversion repository updated every day in the JCL daily page
&nbsp;<a href="http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily/">http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily/</a></p>

<p>To always have access to the most recent changes in the JCL, you
should install a Subversion client (we recommend TortoiseSVN <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a>
and RapidSVN <a href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/</a>) and download the
SVN repository files to your computer as explained in the repository page of the JEDI Wiki at
<a href="http://wiki.delphi-jedi.org/index.php?title=Repository">http://wiki.delphi-jedi.org/index.php?title=Repository</a>&nbsp;
With the SVN client, you can update your local repository at any time.
You can also view the repository online via the web interface at <a href="http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/">http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<h3><a name="contribute">Getting involved in JCL development</a></h3>

If you want to help out making JCL better or bigger or just plain
cooler, there are several ways in which you can help out. Here are some of the
things we need your help on:
<ul>

  <li>Donate source code</li>

  <li>Donate time writing help</li>

  <li>Donate time writing demos</li>

  <li>Donate time fixing bugs</li>

  <li>Share your experience by helping users in newsgroups and mailing lists</li>

</ul>

<p>JCL accepts donations from developers as long as the source fullfills the
requirements set up by the JEDI and JCL teams. To read more about these
requirements, visit the page <a href="http://jcl.delphi-jedi.org/">http://jcl.delphi-jedi.org/</a></p>

<p>You can also donate your time by writing help for the source already
in JCL. We currently use Doc-o-Matic to create the finished help files but
the actual help sources are plain text files in a simple to understand format.
We can provide you with auto-generated templates with all classes, properties,
types etc already inserted. The "only" thing left to do is fill in the actual
help text for the help items. If you are interested in writing help, contact us.</p>

<p>If you want to help fix bugs in JCL, go to Mantis and check the bug report
there. You can post replies as well as fixes directly in the bug report. One of the
JCL developers will pick up the report/fix and update the Subversion repository if the fi
is satisfactory. If you report and fix a lot of bugs, you might even get developer
access to SVN so you can update the JCL files directly.</p>

JEDI Code Library
=================

The JEDI Code Library (JCL) consists of a set of thoroughly tested and fully documented
utility functions and non-visual classes which can be instantly reused in your Delphi
and C++ Builder projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. It is reformatted to achieve
a common look-and-feel, tested, documented and merged into the library. The library is
grouped into several categories such as Strings, Files and I/O, Security, Math and many, many
more. The library is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL)
and as such can be freely used in both freeware/shareware, opensource and commercial projects.
The entire JEDI Code Library is distributed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL).

This includes, but is not limited to, this document and all source code and ancillary files.
Source code files included in the JCL have a header which explicitly states this (as is required)
however, unless noted otherwise, all files including those without an MPL header, are subject
to the MPL license.

Download the ZIP file
---------------------
If you download the JCL as a ZIP file from GitHub, you also have to download the jedi.inc and
kylix.inc files from the <https://github.com/project-jedi/jedi> project and copy them to the
jcl\jcl\source\include\jedi directory.

Clone with GIT
--------------
```
> git clone git://github.com/project-jedi/jcl.git jcl
> cd jcl
> git submodule update --init
```

This will get you the JCL repository and initializes the submodule that contains the jedi.inc and kylix.inc files.

How to install
--------------
Start the **jcl\install.bat**

You can download daily snapshots from <http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily>

Report Bugs
-----------
While we try hard to release bug free software, bugs are a part of reality. So, if you have found any bugs,
please report them to us. To make the bug reporting as efficient as possible, please try to follow these rules:

- Make the report as detailed as possible so we have a fair chance to reproduce and fix it.
- If you have any code that reproduce the problem, attach it to the report (zip file, source only, no dependencies on third-party software).
- Detailed steps are mandatory for us to understand and solve your problem. 
- If you already have a solution you believe will work, include it in the bug report.
- Be prepared to monitor the report after submission since it is very common that we will need additional information.

Contact
-------
The JCL is built by the community, but more importantly, for the community. Therefore we would like to hear from you. If you have
any problems, comments or suggestions we would appreciate it if you would drop us a note. There are several ways to get in contact with us.
Note that we also like to hear about you if everything is fine, as this will let us know that what we do is appreciated.

- Newsgroups
  The newsgroups are the most active forums for discussing the JCL (and other JEDI related topics) and is also the place where the
  JCL developers hang out. The JCL specific group is called **jedi.jcl**, but you are recommended to also subscribe to at least
  **jedi.general** and **jedi.jvcl**.

### r2.0.0 ###

ExoPlayer 2.x is a major iteration of the library. It includes significant API
and architectural changes, new features and many bug fixes. You can read about
some of the motivations behind ExoPlayer 2.x
[here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-why-what-and-when-74fd9cb139#.am7h8nytm).

* Root package name changed to `com.google.android.exoplayer2`. The library
  structure and class names have also been sanitized. Read more
  [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-package-and-class-names-ef8e1d9ba96f#.lv8sd4nez).
* Key architectural changes:
  * Late binding between rendering and media source components. Allows the same
    rendering components to be re-used from one playback to another. Enables
    features such as gapless playback through playlists and DASH multi-period
    support.
  * Improved track selection design. More details can be found
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-track-selection-2b62ff712cc9#.n00zo76b6).
  * LoadControl now used to control buffering and loading across all playback
    types.
  * Media source components given additional structure. A new MediaSource class
    has been introduced. MediaSources expose Timelines that describe the media
    they expose, and can consist of multiple MediaPeriods. This enables features
    such as seeking in live playbacks and DASH multi-period support.
  * Responsibility for loading the initial DASH/SmoothStreaming/HLS manifest is
    promoted to the corresponding MediaSource components and is no longer the
    application's responsibility.
  * Higher level abstractions such as SimpleExoPlayer have been added to the
    library. These make the library easier to use for common use cases. The demo
    app is halved in size as a result, whilst at the same time gaining more
    functionality. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-improved-demo-app-d97171aaaaa1).
  * Enhanced library support for implementing audio extensions. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-audio-features-cfb26c2883a#.ua75vu4s3).
  * Format and MediaFormat are replaced by a single Format class.
* Key new features:
  * Playlist support. Includes support for gapless playback between playlist
    items and consistent application of LoadControl and TrackSelector policies
    when transitioning between items
    ([#1270](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1270)).
  * Seeking in live playbacks for DASH and SmoothStreaming
    ([#291](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/291)).
  * DASH multi-period support
    ([#557](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/557)).
  * MediaSource composition allows MediaSources to be concatenated into a
    playlist, merged and looped. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-mediasource-composition-6c285fcbca1f#.zfha8qupz).
  * Looping support (see above)
    ([#490](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/490)).
  * Ability to query information about all tracks in a piece of media (including
    those not supported by the device)
    ([#1121](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1121)).
  * Improved player controls.
  * Support for PSSH in fMP4 moof atoms
    ([#1143](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1143)).
  * Support for Opus in Ogg
    ([#1447](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1447)).
  * CacheDataSource support for standalone media file playbacks (mp3, mp4 etc).
  * FFMPEG extension (for audio only).
* Key bug fixes:
  * Removed unnecessary secondary requests when playing standalone media files
    ([#1041](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1041)).
  * Fixed playback of video only (i.e. no audio) live streams
    ([#758](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/758)).
  * Fixed silent failure when media buffer is too small
    ([#583](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/583)).
  * Suppressed "Sending message to a Handler on a dead thread" warnings
    ([#426](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/426)).

# Legacy release notes #

Note: Since ExoPlayer V1 is still being maintained alongside V2, there is some
overlap between these notes and the notes above. r2.0.0 followed from r1.5.11,
and hence it can be assumed that all changes in r1.5.11 and earlier are included
in all V2 releases. This cannot be assumed for changes in r1.5.12 and later,

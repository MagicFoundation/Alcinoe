# ExoPlayer Cronet extension #

The Cronet extension is an [HttpDataSource][] implementation using [Cronet][].

[HttpDataSource]: https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/doc/reference/com/google/android/exoplayer2/upstream/HttpDataSource.html
[Cronet]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/cronet?autodive=0%2F%2F

## Build instructions ##

To use this extension you need to clone the ExoPlayer repository and depend on
its modules locally. Instructions for doing this can be found in ExoPlayer's
[top level README][]. In addition, it's necessary to get the Cronet libraries
and enable the extension:

1. Find the latest Cronet release [here][] and navigate to its `Release/cronet`
   directory
1. Download `cronet_api.jar`, `cronet_impl_common_java.jar`,
   `cronet_impl_native_java.jar` and the `libs` directory
1. Copy the three jar files into the `libs` directory of this extension
1. Copy the content of the downloaded `libs` directory into the `jniLibs`
   directory of this extension

* In your `settings.gradle` file, add
  `gradle.ext.exoplayerIncludeCronetExtension = true` before the line that
  applies `core_settings.gradle`.

## Using the extension ##

ExoPlayer requests data through `DataSource` instances. These instances are
either instantiated and injected from application code, or obtained from
instances of `DataSource.Factory` that are instantiated and injected from
application code.

If your application only needs to play http(s) content, using the Cronet
extension is as simple as updating any `DataSource`s and `DataSource.Factory`
instantiations in your application code to use `CronetDataSource` and
`CronetDataSourceFactory` respectively. If your application also needs to play
non-http(s) content such as local files, use
```
new DefaultDataSource(
    ...
    new CronetDataSource(...) /* baseDataSource argument */);
```
and
```
new DefaultDataSourceFactory(
    ...
    new CronetDataSourceFactory(...) /* baseDataSourceFactory argument */);
```
respectively.

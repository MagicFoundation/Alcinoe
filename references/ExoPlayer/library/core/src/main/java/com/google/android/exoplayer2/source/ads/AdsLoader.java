 * Interface for loaders of ads, which can be used with {@link AdsMediaSource}.
 * <p>
 * Ad loaders notify the {@link AdsMediaSource} about events via {@link EventListener}. In
 * particular, implementations must call {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)}
 * with a new copy of the current {@link AdPlaybackState} whenever further information about ads
 * becomes known (for example, when an ad media URI is available, or an ad has played to the end).
 * <p>
 * {@link #attachPlayer(ExoPlayer, EventListener, ViewGroup)} will be called when the ads media
 * source first initializes, at which point the loader can request ads. If the player enters the
 * background, {@link #detachPlayer()} will be called. Loaders should maintain any ad playback state
 * in preparation for a later call to {@link #attachPlayer(ExoPlayer, EventListener, ViewGroup)}. If
 * an ad is playing when the player is detached, store the current playback position via
 * {@link AdPlaybackState#setAdResumePositionUs(long)}.
 * <p>
 * If {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)} has been called, the implementation
 * of {@link #attachPlayer(ExoPlayer, EventListener, ViewGroup)} should invoke the same listener to
 * provide the existing playback state to the new player.

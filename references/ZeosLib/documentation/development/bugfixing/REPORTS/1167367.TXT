Error Description:
Using: 
Zeos 6.1.5 patch 2
Delphi 6, with all updates
MySql 4.0.18

I'm updating a field of type MySql type 'text' in a 
TZQuery. When assigning a new value to this field i'm 
getting Access Violations wich i've traced back to 
TZAbstractRODataset.SetFieldData. This function copies 
the data from an incoming buffer pointer to the row data. 
For a text field in mysql the maximum size is 64k and 
the function therfore tries to move 64k bytes from the 
buffer to the row data. This causes an accessviolation 
because, apparently, less then 64k bytes is allocated to 
hold the new data. 
When (close to) 64k of data is inserted there is never a 
problem, it only happens when the ammount of text 
assigned to the value is significantly smaller then the 
maximum of 64k. 
So the buffer allocated for the new data is only as large 
as it needs to be wich sounds logical. Yet the Zeos code 
assumes the size of the buffer is always the same as 
Field.Size.

There's a forum thread about this problem here: 
http://www.zeoslib.net/modules.php?
name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=1958

I will try to produce a small test project.

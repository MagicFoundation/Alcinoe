Summary:
  TJclComplex implements various operations with complex numbers.
Description:
  TJclComplex is designated to provide complex numbers computations for your
  applications. It supports both rectangular and polar number representations.
  All the operations are divided into groups as follows:
    * basic arithmetics;
    * natural logarithmic and exponential functions;
    * trigonometric functions;
    * hyperbolic trigonometric functions;
    * complex Bessel functions;
    * various miscellaneous routines.
  All the methods could be used in two ways. Firstly you can use the methods
  with the prefix "C", like CAdd or CLn to perform the operation over the
  object itself, i.e. after using such methods the value of the object itself
  will be changed. Using these methods gives you the opportunity to use quite a
  convenient method of coding the sequential calculations like this:
    MyComplex.Add(4,3).Mul(2,5).Ln.AsString;
  The other way is two use the subset of methods with "CNew" prefix. They do the
  same computations but as the result they create a new object of TComplex type.
  It might be useful in situations when you'd like to remain your object intact
  and get the result in a separate object. Please note that such an approach
  requires a very attentive coding style when you need to destroy every object
  after every "CNew*" method invocation.

@@TJclComplex.FracLength
Summary:
  Determines the precision used in formatting the value of the complex number.
Description:
  Use FracLength to set the number of digits beyond the decimal point that
  the value should be formatted to before rounding begins. FracLength affects
  the format of the floating-point value when it is displayed using properties AsString or AsPolarString,
  not the actual floating-point
  value that is stored in the complex number structures.
  The default value of FracLength is 8 decimal places.
Notes:
  FracLength must be less or equal to 18. Trying to set FracLength to a value greater than 18 changes the value of FracLength to 18.

Summary:
  Creates a new TComplex object.
Description:
  Call Create to construct a complex number object either equal to (0,0) or

Parameters:
  X - The real part in the rectangular representation or radius in polar coordinates.
  Y - The imaginary part in the rectangular representation or angle (in grads) in polar coordinates.

Notes:
  All the calculations with complex numbers are performed with their rectangular representation members, except those that requires polar coordinates instead like exponential functions for instance.
  The results of the calculations as well as the value of the complex number itself might be obtained in either rectangular or polar representation at any time using AsString or AsPolarString respectively.

Description:
  Use AsString property to obtain a string representation of the complex number
  formatted according to the canonical form of complex numbers in rectangular
  representation. FracLength property is used to determine the
  precision of float parts of the complex number. For example if your complex

  following string as the result of calling AsString: 5.23-3.60i
  Also you might use this property to assign the value of a

  a complex number in its canonical rectangular form like this: x+yi, where

@@TJclComplex.CNewExp
Summary:
  Evaluates the exponential curve for the value of the current complex number object and creates a new resulting complex number object.
Description:
  Use CNewExp method to evaluate the exponential curve for the value of the current
  complex number object and get a new resulting object of TJclComplex type.
Result:
  Method CNewExp returns a newly created object of TJclComplex type that contains
  the value computed.
Notes:
  Complex number exponential curve is evaluated according to the following formula: Exp(Z) = [Exp(x)*Cos(y); Exp(x)*Sin(y)], where Z = (x; y).
  For changing the value of the calling object instead of creating a new resulting object use CExp method.

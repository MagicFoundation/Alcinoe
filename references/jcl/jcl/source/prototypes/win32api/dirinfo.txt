This is the directory where include files for JclWin32.pas reside.

Each file is named after the Platform SDK header file from which it originates.

*.int files shall be included in the interface section.
*.imp files shall be included in the implementation section.

line numbers at present refer to the Jwa* units [*] from which the 
code has been ripped off, not to the original header file.

# Scope

The amazing Synopse *mORMot* Framework is a powerful piece of code, but it's missing examples. Thus I found it a good idea to write my own demo, and allow others to improve it.

# Presentation

I decided to build a very trivial yet closer to real life demo of the *mORmot* Framework.

The main reason behind this decision was to learn the Framework a bit smile

Currently the application is just a list of Customers with Tasks assigned to them (the relation type is "HAS MANY AND BELONGS TO MANY"). In my case, TCustomer publishes TTasks list.

I've also decided to share the code in hope that if anybody knows the better way for solving any of the "tasks", he might edit & share.

# Source Code Repository

The original code is available at http://code.google.com/p/synopse-sqlite-demo/

*AB note*: I've enhanced the code to compile and work with the 1.18 revision of the framework. Also made it Delphi 2010+ friendly.

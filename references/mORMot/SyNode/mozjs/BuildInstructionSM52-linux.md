Before proceeding Spider Monkey build pease consider reading general Mozilla sources build instructuions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions and author's recommended approach to build Spider Monkey at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation. You may also find usefull following hiperlinks in the documents and read more about Mozilla sources in general. Basic knowledge of C/C++ language and linux build tools whould be helpfull when reading this documentation.

The "zero" step when building Mozilla sources is to prepare build box. Do this according to the Mozilla documentation at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Linux_Prerequisites.
It worth to note that this instruction has been checked against Ubuntu GNOME v16.04. You may find some differences building Mozilla sources on another version of Linux.

At the moment of writing this instruction there was no official release of Spider Monkey v52. At a later time you whould be able to find official sources of this version at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Releases.
Currently it is possible to download nightly build from official repository at https://hg.mozilla.org/releases or use source control tools  to retrive sources from any of the Mozilla source control repositories.
The author recommends to use git as a tool to take sources from GitHub.
Issue the following command in a terminal window to clone GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev.git

Be prepared for long wait - cloning the repository may take up to half an hour or so depending on build box hardware and the Internet connection speed.
This retrieves all Mozilla sources. A few different programs can be built using this sources like FireFox or Thunder Bird. But there is no way to retrive only part of the sources needed to build Spider Monkey only.
Upon finish dive into the root sources directory and checkout branch esr52. Please note - you should _not_ use master branch to build Spider Monkey v52!

cd gecko-dev
git checkout esr52

Now it's time to apply patch to the sources provided by SyNode:
git apply <mORMot_sources_root>/SyNode/mozjs/esr52-git.patch

Spider Monkey sources are located at "js\src":
cd js/src

Next run autoconfigure comand:
autoconf2.13

The next step is to crate the directory for build artifacts. It is recommended to use _OPT.OBJ directory for that (exact spelling), it's due to current state of .gitignore file.
mkdir _OPT.OBJ
cd _OPT.OBJ

After that configure sources. This should be done by issuing the following command from the build artifacts directory:
../configure --enable-ctypes --disable-jemalloc --enable-nspr-build --disable-debug-symbols

The options stated should be used to successfully build and run SyNode.

And now run build itself:
make

Upon successfull build go to dist/bin subdirectory and take libmozjs-52.so library. It is recommended to copy this file to /usr/lib directory

  Version 1.18
  - first public release, corresponding to mORMot Framework 1.18

  DISCLAIMER:

   Purpose of this unit is to patch the system.pas unit for older versions
   of Delphi, so that WideString memory allocation would use FastMM4 instead
   of the slow BSTR Windows API.

   It will speed up the WideString process a lot, especially when a lot of
   content is allocated, since FastMM4 is much more aggressive than Windows'
   global heap and the BSTR slow API. It could be more than 50 times faster,
   especially when releasing the used memory.

   The WideString implementation pattern does NOT feature Copy-On-Write, so is
   slower than the string=UnicodeString type as implemented since Delphi 2009.
   This is the reason why this unit won't do anything on Unicode versions of
   the compiler, since the new string type is to be preferred.

  HOW TO USE:

   Just add the unit at the TOP of your .dpr uses clause, just after FastMM4
   (if you use it, and you should!) i.e. before all other units used by your
   program. It should be initialized before any WideString is allocated.

   Then the patch will be applied at runtime. Nothing to recompile!

    program MyProgram;

    uses
      {$I SynDprUses.inc}    // will enable FastMM4 prior to Delphi 2006
      SynFastWideString,     // will use FastMM4 prior to Delphi 2009
      ...

  NOTE:

   Since we add a trailing 0 byte at the end of the buffer, we need the
   memory manager to let enough place for it: oldest Borland MM does not :(
   SO IF YOU WORK WITH A VERSION PRIOR TO DELPHI 2006, ADD FASTMM4 TO YOUR .DPR

  WARNING:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
    USING THIS UNIT MAY BREAK COMPATIBILITY WITH OLE/COM LIBRARIES !
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   You won't be able to retrieve and release WideString/BSTR variables from an
   OleDB / ADO database provider, or any COM object.
   Do not use this unit if you are calling such external call!

   In practice, if you only SEND some BSTR content to the provider (e.g. if
   you use our SynOleDB unit without stored procedure call, or if you use
   TWideString fields for most SynDBDataSet classes), it will work.
   You would have issues only if you *retrieve* a BSTR from the COM object,
   or expect the COM object to *change* the BSTR size, e.g. with a "var"
   WideString parameter or a COM method returning a WideString. In this case,
   you could use the WideStringFree() procedure to release such an instance.

   It is for educational purpose only, and/or if you are 100% sure that your
   code will stay self-contained, under Delphi 7 or Delphi 2007, and need use
   of WideString instead of string=AnsiString.

   -----------------------------------------------
    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !   :)
   -----------------------------------------------

/// this low-level helper can be used to free a WideString returned by COM/OLE
// - WideString instances created with this unit can be safely sent to any
// COM/OLE object, as soon as they are constant parameters, but not a "var"
// parameter or a callback function result
// - any WideString instance returned by a COM object should NOT be released
// by Delphi automatically, since the following would create a memory error:
// ! TrueBSTRWideStringVariable := '';
// - if you are using SynFastWideString, you should use this procedure to
// release true BSTR WideString instance, as such:
// ! type
// !  _Catalog = interface(IDispatch)
// !    // this method will be safe to use with our unit
// !    function Create(const ConnectString: WideString): OleVariant; safecall;
// !    // this method won't be safe, since it returns a true BSTR as WideString
// !    function GetObjectOwner(const ObjectName: WideString; ObjectType: OleVariant;
// !                            ObjectTypeId: OleVariant): WideString; safecall;
// ! end;
// !...
// !function CheckCatalogOwner(const catalog: _Catalog): string;
// !var bstr: WideString;
// !begin
// !  try // force manual handling of this true BSTR instance lifetime
// !   bstr := catalog.GetObjectOwner('name',null,null);
// !   result := bstr; // conversion to string will work
// !  finally
// !    WideStringFree(bstr); // manual release, and set bstr := nil
// !  end;
// !end;

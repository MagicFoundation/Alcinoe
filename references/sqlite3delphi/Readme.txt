Complete SQLite3 API translation and simple wrapper for Delphi and FreePascal

Version: 1.0 (March 10, 2010)
Version of SQLite: 3.6.22


DESCRIPTION
===========
  SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless,
  zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The source code for
  SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose,
  commercial or private. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine
  in the world.

  This package contains complete SQLite3 API translation for Delphi and
  FreePascal, as well as a simple Unicode-enabled object wrapper to simplify
  the use of this database engine.


COMPATIBILITY
=============
  Compatible with Delphi/C++Builder 6-2010 and FreePascal/Lazarus.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE NOTES
============================
  Unzip the package somewhere on your hard drive. Now you need to add the full
  path of the Source folder to your IDE options.

  For Delphi 6-7 or C++Builder 6:
  Select Tools > Environment Options from the menu, then go to the Library tab
  and add the full path of this package's Source directory to the Library Path.

  For Delphi 2005 and up, or C++Builder 2006 and up:
  Select Tools > Options from the menu, then select Environment Options >
  Delphi Options > Library - Win32, and add the full path of this package's
  Source directory to the Library Path.

  For Lazarus:
  Select Environment > Options from the menu, then select CodeTools, and add
  the full path of this package's Source directory to the Search Path
  ("Additional source search path for all projects").

  When using this translation in your projects, add the SQLite3 unit to the
  uses clause of your source file, if you want to use SQLite3 API, and the
  SQLite3Wrap unit, if you want to use the accompanying wrapper.

  Do not forget to distribute the shared library (sqlite3.dll for Windows,
  sqlite3.so for Linux) with your program.

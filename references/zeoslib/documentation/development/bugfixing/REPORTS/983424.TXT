Actions done form Bugfixing:

This is no bug of Zeos.

DBScreen is not nil when using the unit DB which is used by 
several units of zeos, BUT is is initialized with a class-object
which is not changing the cursor, the user sees (Forms.
Screen.Cursor). This Object is initialized in unit DBCtrls.

If you want to see the SQLHourGlass then you should add the 
unit DBCtrls to your uses-clause.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server (and Version) : n/a
ZEOSLib Version      : 6.5.1 alpha
Component/Class      : TZConnection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requested Feature:

I would like to have to following feature:

The TZConnection should have a published read-only 
property 'Version', showin the actual version.
It´s very difficult when you work in a team to check, if 
everybody is using the same Version of ZEOS DBO.

I think many other users would confirm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actions done for adding the new feature:

Added const ZEOS_VERSION to ZClasses and added property Version to TZConnection.

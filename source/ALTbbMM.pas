product:      ALTbbMM
Version:      4.01

Description:  A simple wrapper around the Intel Threading Building Blocks memory allocation
              library - tbbmalloc.dll. Implements memory manager based on Intel TBB
              memory allocator.

Usage:        Put this unit to the very first place on your program in section "uses".
              It should look like:

              uses ALTbbMM,
                   ...,
                   System.Classes,
                   etc...

              Be sure that your application can reach the dll "tbbmalloc.dll". A prebuilt
              version of this libraries for Win32 and Win64 are provided together with
              Alcinoe and can be found on the folders "dll\tbbmalloc\...".

              The latest version of the DLL could be downloaded from the web-site of
              Intel Threading Building:
              - https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/

              You will need to download the latest version archived for your operation
              system from the downloading page:
               - https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download

              Inside of this archive you will find directory "bin" that will contain required DLL.
              Take a note that they have very strange naming. So "Intel64" refers to the 64-bit
              applications that is logical. But "IA32" refers to all the 32-bit applications.
              You can be easily confused thinking that IA means Intel Itanium but it doesn't,
              i don't know why they decided to name its folder like this and there is a lot of
              complainings in the official forums from the people that cannot find 32-bit version
              of the dynamical library. Inside you will discover many subfolders named as "vc10",
              "vc11" etc. They are aligned for the corresponding version of MSVC-compiler bundled
              with their corresponding version of Visual Studio. There are identical libraries
              but built with different versions of compiler. it's seam that dll compiled with the last
              version of visual studio are a little more faster than dll compiled with the first
              version but you will need to run adequate vcredist
